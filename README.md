# Versioneer

An opinionated standalone tool used to quickly version Git repos that wraps around [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog) projects.

The goal of this project is to make versioning a portable as possible.

> It's also a learning experience for [me](https://github.com/johnnyhuy) ☺️

## 🏆 Features

```

Use the VSCode JavaScript Terminal to start debugging!
