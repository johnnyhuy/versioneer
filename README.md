# Versioneer

An *opinionated* standalone tool used to quickly version Git repos that wraps around [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog) projects.

The goal of this project is to make versioning a portable as possible.

### It's yet another versioning tool

This is a learning experience to distribute a CLI package across different platforms.

### Alternatives

This tool may not suit your project. However, there are plenty of more mature open source projects that solve version release management.

- [`semantic-release/semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
- [`conventional-changelog/standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

We can use [VSCode dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to quickly spin up a NodeJS environment through [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Once the environment is setup, just install Node packages.

```bash
npm i
```

Use the VSCode JavaScript Terminal to start debugging!
