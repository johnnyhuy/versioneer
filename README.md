# Versioneer

An *opinionated* standalone tool used to quickly version Git repos that wraps around [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog) projects.

The goal of this project is to make versioning a portable as possible.

### It's yet another versioning tool

This is a learning experience to distribute a CLI package across different platforms.

### Alternatives

This tool may not suit your project. However, there are plenty of more mature open source projects that solve version release management.

- [`release-it/release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#git)
- [`semantic-release/semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
- [`conventional-changelog/standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

## üèÜ Features

- Bumps Git tags based on [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Version rollback
- Commits version bumps to `package.json`
- GitHub release generation
- Purges all tags
- Multi-platform - MacOS x64 & ARM, Windows x64, Linux x64, Docker

## üìú Configuration

Versioneer will use **environment variables first** before looking for a versioneer configuration file.

VERSIONEER_DEBUG=true | false
```

### Configuration file `.versioneer.yaml`

Aliases include `.versioneer.yaml`, `.versioner`

```yaml
debug: true | false

  force: true | false
  dryRun: true | false

rollback:

```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing

Any feedback is welcome! Fork out and raise a pull request.

We can use [VSCode dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to quickly spin up a NodeJS environment through [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Once the environment is setup, just install Node packages.

```bash
npm i
```

Use the VSCode JavaScript Terminal to start debugging!
